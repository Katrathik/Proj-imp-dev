const responseData = `A subdural hematoma is a serious condition where there is bleeding inside your head, between your brain and its outer covering. It's like a bruise, but it's deep inside and can be very dangerous.

**Self-care and Health Needs:**

If you think you or someone else has a subdural hematoma:

- **Rest:** It is vital to rest and avoid any activities that could result in a bump or blow to the head. No sports, strenuous activities, or risky play.
- **Monitor:** Keep a close eye on any possible symptoms, like persistent headaches, blurred vision, or trouble walking.
- **Ice:** Applying ice packs to the area around the injury can help reduce swelling and pain. Make sure to wrap the ice pack in a thin towel to avoid direct contact with the skin.
- **Medicine:** Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage any discomfort or inflammation.
- **No Alcohol:** Avoid consuming alcohol, as it can increase the risk of bleeding and slow down the healing process.
- **Medical Attention:** It is crucial to seek immediate medical attention if any symptoms worsen or new ones develop, such as repeated vomiting, seizures, or unusual behavior changes.

**Symptoms of a Cardiac Problem:**

Early detection of cardiac problems can save lives. Here are some symptoms to watch out for:

- **Shortness of Breath:** Having difficulty breathing, feeling winded, or experiencing shortness of breath, especially when lying down or with minimal exertion.
- **Heart Palpitations:** Being aware of your heartbeat, feeling like your heart is racing, pounding, fluttering, or beating irregularly.
- **Extreme Fatigue:** Unusual and overwhelming tiredness, even with minimal activity or at rest.
- **Swelling:** Noticing swelling in your legs, ankles, feet, or abdomen, which could indicate fluid retention.
- **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or dizzy, especially when standing up or exerting yourself.
